							<li>We take reasonable care in linking <em>australia.gov.au</em> to other websites but we

							<li>We use the following criteria to select the links that are included on this site:
								<ul class="normalList">
									<li>The content must be authentic. <em>australia.gov.au</em> will primarily link to
										government content or websites known to be sponsored by the Australian
										Government. Every effort is made to ensure the links are as current and as
										complete as possible, however due to the consistent process of change on
										government websites there will inevitably be a small amount of out-of-date or
										missing content at any point of time.</li>
									<li>The content should be up-to-date and accurate. Links will be made in good faith
										with the expectation that the content is appropriately maintained by the author
										and is timely and accurate. However, we can offer no guarantees of this.</li>
									<li>Please note that there are exceptions. Due to the nature of Australian Stories,
										their content may include links to a variety of Australian, state, territory and
										local government cultural agencies as well as to commercial websites and
										organisations.</li>

							</li>
							<li>You may link to this website as long as you do not:
								<ul class="normalList">
									<li>imply that the Australian Government endorses your website or product</li>
									<li>use <em>australia.gov.au</em> solely for commercial practices</li>
									<li>change the content of the material technically (eg the material is presented in
										a frame so that users are unable to determine the location of the original
										material).</li>
								</ul>
